# In-Class-Assignment-Week-4
This is repository to store starter project for In-Class-Assignment-Week-4


## Objective
### Demonstrate the following:

1. Usage of Eclipse / GitHub
2. Variable Assignment - Operators
3. Object oriented design, Implement class
4. Constructor 
5. User Interaction with multiple options
6. Implementing Methods in classes

### Instructions
* Clone project into your workspace and import it in Eclipse
* Learn usage of GitHub
* Commit your code after each questions implementation
* Practice GitHub Desktop/Git in Eclipse (your preference)

		
1.	In main class ask user to input 2 integers and then write a new java class "FunWithMath" write a method that prints the following: (call methods with the integer values you get from user)
			
      a.	Sum of the integers
      b.	Difference of the integers
	  c.	Product of the integers

2.	In a new Java class “GasCalculator” create constructor with following 2 parameters:
			
      a.	The number of gallons of gas in the tank – as an integer
	  b.	The price of gas per gallon – as a double
			
      Then print the total cost to fill up the gas tank as method and call it from main class

3.	In a "FunWithMath" class write a method “converter” and pass a measurement in meters and then prints this measurement in miles, feet, and inches.
